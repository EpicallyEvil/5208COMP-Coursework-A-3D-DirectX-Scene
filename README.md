My coursework for the 5208COMP module I did as part of my game development degree in the second year.
To run the project set the debugger to "Debug" "Win32 with the "5208COMP-Coursework-Template" vcxproj as the startup project.

This scene was built in Visual Studio 2022 using DirectX11 in C++ everything was handcoded apart from the base engine we was given to use which was a black screen. 
During this module I was taught about 3D computer graphics and the advanced math behind them. 
I learnt how to use models within my own project, how to spawn them in and transform them to make a realistic looking scene.
